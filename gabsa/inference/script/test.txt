Polite acknowledgement is out ;####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
supercilious scorn is in .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer  (which was delicious ) .####[('server', 'service general', 'negative'), ('appetizer', 'food quality', 'positive')]
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn 't sat cooling in front of the guest .####[('food', 'food quality', 'positive'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list  (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins )####[('fit-out', 'ambience general', 'positive'), ('furnishings', 'ambience general', 'positive'), ('wine list', 'drinks style_options', 'positive'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
At  $120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .####[('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]

Everything was going good until we got our meals .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive'), ('meals', 'food quality', 'negative')]
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .####[('chicken', 'food style_options', 'negative')]
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####[('NULL', 'food style_options', 'negative'), ('spinach', 'food quality', 'negative')]
I took one bite from the  $24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .####[('salmon', 'food quality', 'negative'), ('salmon', 'food prices', 'negative')]
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn 't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .####[('waitress', 'service general', 'negative')]
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .####[('spinach', 'food quality', 'negative')]
I couldn 't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .####[('NULL', 'food style_options', 'negative')]
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .####[('NULL', 'food quality', 'negative')]
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says ,  "oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier " No apology , nothing .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she didn 't like it , and I cannot comp it .####[('manager', 'service general', 'negative')]
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
The level of rudeness was preposterous .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]

If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .####[('place', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]

This place . . .god where do i begin .####[('place', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .####[('scene', 'ambience general', 'positive')]

Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####[('menu', 'food prices', 'negative')]
But nonetheless--great spot , great food .####[('spot', 'restaurant general', 'positive'), ('food', 'food quality', 'positive')]
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don 't put you off â€“ ####[('food', 'food quality', 'positive'), ('front of house staff', 'service general', 'negative')]
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years . ####[('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'negative')]
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff  (not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return . ####[('waiters', 'service general', 'positive'), ('front of house staff', 'service general', 'negative'), ('fish dishes', 'food quality', 'positive')]
As BFC doesn 't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####[('BFC', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative'), ('front of house staff', 'service general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
The frizzy retro girl  (with winged / Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink . ####[('girl', 'service general', 'negative')]
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she  "had a BBQ to go to " that night - WTF ? ?####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####[('staff', 'service general', 'negative')]
There 's another girl who I can 't describe , she is about 5 '6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're  *really * talking about . ####[('girl', 'service general', 'negative')]
I 'm a friendly person , so I wouldn 't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal . ####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
Considering you will spend at least  $60 a head , I expect better service . ####[('service', 'service general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'negative')]

His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
A word to the wise : you can 't dine here and disturb the maitre-D 's sense of  " table turnover " , as whacked as it is , or else .####[('maitre-D', 'service general', 'negative')]
If you go here , do it on his off-night .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]

There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .####[('staff', 'service general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'food quality', 'negative'), ('wait', 'service general', 'negative')]
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]

The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating  (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) .####[('waitress', 'service general', 'negative')]
I couldn 't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
